# write a query that's going to return the number of employees in a department, but I only want to see the departments where the total salary paid in that
 department is greater than 5 million.
 Also, when you return the results, the results should be ordered from the highest to the lowest total salary.
 
 #Solution  
 
 SELECT departement_id, sum(salary)
 from data_sci.employees
 groupe by departement_id
 having sum(salaty) >50000000
 order by sum (salary) desc
